### About me:

My research subject is a variety of testate amoeba communities, with focus on those inhabiting *Sphagnum* peatlands. Anthropogenic influence on these fragile ecosystems is of particular interest for me, so I am working on developing an user-friendly and robust tool for bioindication and monitoring, using functional traits.

### ðŸŒ± My ongoing projects are related to: 

- Variation of functional traits of testate amoebae along various ecological gradients and in relation to ecosystem functioning
- Functional trait approach as an alternative to traditional taxonomy-based methods (for palaeoreconstructions, bioindication, etc.)
- Biases (observer bias, confirmation bias, etc.) and uncertainty in natural sciences 
- Tools and techniques for open science and reproducibility
