### My research interests:

My main research subject is the development of a functional traits approach to study the ecology of protists. I focus specifically on testate amoebae, inhabiting *Sphagnum* peatlands, which are commonly used as bioindicators of water table depth, a critical factor controlling the functioning of peatlands and especially their carbon balance. *Sphagnum* peatlands have been intensively damaged or destroyed due to peat extraction, drained for afforestation or agricultural use, but are now being restored in many places. Testate amoebae provide the long-term ecological history and reference of pre-disturbance ecological status through palaeoecological reconstruction and are also used to assess the success of restoration efforts. Testate amoeba analysis is based on morphological identification, which is subject to the observerâ€™s bias. By recording traits, which are more objective, I believe that the reliability and applicability of this tool could be improved. I am assessing the identification bias and developing and testing a user-friendly and robust tool for bioindication and monitoring, using testate amoebae functional traits.

### ðŸŒ± My ongoing projects are related to: 

- Biases (observer bias, confirmation bias, etc.) and uncertainty in natural sciences.
- Variation of functional traits of testate amoebae along the main ecological gradients in peatlands and in relation to ecosystem functioning.
- Functional trait approach as an alternative to traditional taxonomy-based methods (for palaeo-environmental reconstructions, bioindication, etc.).
- Exploring and developing tools and techniques for open science and reproducibility , which can be used in fundamental and applied protistology.
